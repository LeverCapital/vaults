## Architecture

- [`Vault.sol`](src/Vault.sol): Vault contract which keeps track of PnL and ensures secure and non-custodial deposit/withdrawal of funds during trading. There are 2 ways to do this:
  - `Keep a balance sheet`: Every deposit is recorded. During withdrawal, the deposit is returned +/- the PnL of the vault.
  - `Vault tokens`: Mint vault tokens and give them to user on deposit. During withdrawal, burn these tokens and return the invested funds (with PnL added).
- [`VaultFactory.sol`](src/VaultFactory.sol): Factory which enables deploying a Vault contract for any strategy.
- [`modules/`](src/modules): Contracts used for managing and/or simplifying interaction with Vaults and the Vault Factory.
  - [`VaultRouterModule.sol`](src/modules/VaultRouterModule.sol): Module that enables depositing ETH and approval-free deposits via permit.
  - [`VaultConfigurationModule.sol`](src/modules/VaultConfigurationModule.sol): Module for configuring Vault parameters.
  - [`VaultInitializationModule.sol`](src/modules/VaultInitializationModule.sol): Module for initializing newly created Vaults.
- [`interfaces/`](src/interfaces): Interfaces of external contracts Vaults and modules interact with.
  - [`Strategy.sol`](src/interfaces/Strategy.sol): Minimal interfaces for ERC20 and ETH compatible strategies.
